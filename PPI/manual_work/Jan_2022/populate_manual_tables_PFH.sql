--comments:

-- Reverse relationships are built by generic 
-- Please look at 'PPI conventions'  when work on relationships
-- Use "PPI parent code of" between Module-Topic, Topic-Question, Question-Answer (check PPI conventions)
-- We build hierarchial relationship 'Is a' only for old-logic concepts, for new-logic we use only "Has PPI parent code","Has answer (PPI)", "Maps to" and reverse relationships


-- Has answer (PPI) | Has PPI parent code
-- Maps to -- for mapping to itself

## OHDSI Standardized Vocabularies

This repo contains the build process for the Standardized Vocabularies, which is part of ATHENA.

**You do not have to clone and run this to create a vocabulary.** Instead, download all the necessary files from http://athena.ohdsi.org

If you do want to recreate the vocabulary please find the step-by-step description in each vocabulary's README.

Please refer to the [Wiki page](https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/wiki) in this repo for more information on the Vocabularies structure, processes and the Team.
